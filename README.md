# DatedKeys
## Simple library that allows to generate keys holding an expiry date.

DateKeys a simple, easy to use library which allows you to generate keys which hold an expiry date in it.
I made this project for learning and trying to get a working generator.
However, if you would like to use it in your project (note that this is not recommended), the library is available as a NuGet package!
